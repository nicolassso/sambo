        <p>More than tradition, Sambô Rodizio is the result of a long walk, from the south of Brazil, with its roots in the countryside of Paraná, where everything started, surrounded by all the tradition and proudness of the Brazilian Churrasco served on skewers, the RODIZIO. Originated in the zone of Pampa Southern Brazil, it quickly became a part of Brazil´s National Brand.</p>
